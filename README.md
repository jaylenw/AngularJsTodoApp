#AngularJs Todo App [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaylenw/AngularJsTodoApp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaylenw/AngularJsTodoApp)

Android version of this app is available [here](https://github.com/jaylenw/IonicTodoApp). Desktop version of this app is available [here](https://github.com/jaylenw/ElectronTodoApp).

This repo is designed for you to deploy your own backend and edit the necessary files here to work with it. However, I will soon provide a production version of this by specifying a url where anyone may sign up and use it themselves.

##Description

Users are able to use this App as a Todo-List or a Note Taking application.

##Features

* User Login, Logout, & Registration
* Add, Edit, Delete, and Archive Notes
* Supports Markdown
* Mobile Friendly

## Build, Testing, & Development

1. Install Git on the system by running the command: sudo apt install git

2. Need to have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), and [Bower](https://bower.io/) installed on your system globally. This guide assumes you are running a 16.04 LTS 64bit Ubuntu system. If running a Debian/Ubuntu system and you do not have the packages installed globally, run these commands below:

        sudo apt update  
        sudo apt install nodejs  
        sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node  
        sudo apt install npm
        sudo npm install -g npm
        sudo npm install -g bower
        sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

3. Clone the repository by running: git clone https://github.com/'YourGitHubUserName'/AngularJsTodoApp.git

4. In the root of the project folder, run `npm install` and `bower install`.

5. Run `grunt serve` for live preview. You can then browse the site after opening your browser to the url that grunt has informed you. 

6. Run `grunt test` to make sure the app will past some unit testing if you are making changes to the app. This is a small safety measure to make sure your changes do not have an adverse effect. 


Note: You will not be able to register or login with an account until the backend is setup correctly.


## Running in Production

1. Change the javascript file in /app/scripts/services/, config.js to have your                     url and port number
   that will be directing requests to your backend for the `_apiUrl` variable. Do not change anything after the port number. Forever (server we will be using) by default listens to port 3000. Replace "yourdomain.com" with the domain you will be using. It will look like this, "http://yourdomain.com/3000"

1. Run `grunt build` in the root of the project folder.

2. Copy the files in the `dist` folder onto a webserver to serve the static files. In this case, here is an example nginx config file.

        #yourdomain.com

        server {

              listen 80; #listening on port 80
              server_name yourdomain.com; #remember to make modifications to hosts file in /etc/hosts
              root /home/exampleUser/AngularTodoPRJ/dist;
              index index.html;
              location / {

                      error_page 404 /index.html; #added error page redirection

                      }
        }


### Setting up the Backend

This app depends on the backend to run properly.

1. The backend for this app is found here at this repo: https://github.com/jaylenw/ToDoBackend

2. To run the backend, first clone the repo above. Second, install forever from npm globally, `npm install forever -g`. You may    need to run `sudo npm install forever -g` if on Ubuntu/Debian.
   Use [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) to run the backend server. Forever will make sure your app will continuously run and restart it if the process stops unexpectedly.

3. Next, install mongodb on your system globally and have it running. If on a Ubuntu/Debian system, you would run
   `sudo apt install mongodb`.

4. After having cloned the repo linked above and are in the root of the folder, run `npm install`.

5. Use forever to start the server, run `forever start bin/www`.

6. You should now be able to get and post tasks to the server after registering an account through your site.

7. If you need to kill `forever` for any reasons, run `forever list`. You will then see a list of all `forever` processes. Kill the `forever` process you want
by identifying the `pid` and killing it by running `forever stop pidNUM` where pidNUM is the pid number is the process you would like to kill.
